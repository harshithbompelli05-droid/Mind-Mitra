                I don't feel confident
            </div>

            <div class="bot-message".>It is completely normal to have days—or seasons—where your confidence feels low. Please know that not feeling confident right now does not mean you are incapable.
Here is an encouraging message for when you feel this way:
💫 A Reminder for You 💫
You don't need to feel 100% confident to take the next step. Confidence isn’t a requirement for starting; it is a result of starting. It is built in moments of courage, not moments of certainty.
You don’t have to be perfect: "Be messy and complicated and afraid and show up anyways".
Your worth isn’t based on your feelings: "You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think".
Start small: "If you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run then walk, if you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward".
Action is what builds momentum. The confidence you are looking for will follow after you start, not before. You have already survived 100% of your bad days. You have the strength to get through this, too.
"You’ve got this."
💡 Tips to Rebuild Your Confidence
Reframe the Fear: Instead of focusing on "What if I fail?" ask, "What if I learn something?".
Celebrate Small Wins: Acknowledge your small achievements, like completing a task or simply getting started.
Be Kind to Yourself: Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a best friend in this situation.
Take Action First: Confidence comes after you try, not before.
