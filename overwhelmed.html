            I feel overwhemled.

        <div class="bot-message".>I hear you, and I want to start by saying: it is completely okay to feel overwhelmed. Please don't beat yourself up for being overwhelmed. It is not a sign of weakness, and it certainly isn't a sign that you are failing. It is simply proof that you are carrying too much, caring too much, and pushing yourself too hard for too long.
When you feel like you are drowning in tasks, expectations, or emotions, remember this: You were never meant to carry the weight of everything alone. You were meant to be held by peace, by grace, and by a strength greater than your own.
Here is some encouragement for this moment:
You don’t have to do it all at once. Take a deep breath. Life can get heavy, but you don't have to carry it all today.
Progress, not perfection. It is okay to not have everything figured out right now. Be gentle with yourself—you are doing your best, and that is more than enough.
This, too, shall pass. This feeling is temporary, not a permanent state. You have gotten through 100% of your hardest days so far, and you will get through this one, too.
Give yourself permission to pause. Taking a break is not a sign of weakness; it is a necessary part of self-care. It’s not selfish to love yourself in the process and invest in you so that you can be better for everyone else.
You are stronger than you realize. The human capacity for burden is like bamboo—far more flexible than you’d ever believe at first glance.
Today, focus on what you can control and let go of the rest. You are doing better than you think, and I am rooting for you. Take it one step, one hour, one moment at a time. You have got this🤍🌿.
