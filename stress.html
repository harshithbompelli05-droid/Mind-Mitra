                I feel stressed about exams.
            </div>

            <div class="bot-message">It is completely normal to feel stressed about exams, but please remember that this feeling is temporary, and you are stronger than your anxiety. Stress often means you care about your future, but don't let it cloud your potential—you are capable of more than you know. 
Here are some encouraging thoughts to help you through this time:
You Know More Than You Think: Trust in your preparation. Every hour you have spent studying has built up strength and knowledge inside you.
Progress Over Perfection: You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to do your best, and that is enough. One small, consistent step forward is better than none.
Exams Don’t Define Your Worth: An exam is just one step on your journey, not the final destination. It tests what you remember on one day, not who you are or your value as a person.
Take a Deep Breath: If you feel overwhelmed, stop. Take a moment to breathe, walk around, or get some sleep. A well-rested brain performs better than one that has been awake all night.
You’ve Got This: You have overcome difficult challenges before, and you will overcome this one too. 
Keep your eyes on the finish line, take it one step at a time, and don't forget to believe in yourself. You are ready!📚🌟.
